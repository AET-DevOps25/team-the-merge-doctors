# Meeting Notes 2025-06-15

- We can deploy to both Kubernetes and the Cloud. Should have deployments for both.
- What is the whole pipeline we are supposed to have at the end? @Aniruddh while let us know
- API Gateway? Traefik or Nginx?
  - Answer: Use one of them
- Database deployment? can be in kubernetes
- grpc or rest api between microservices? both are possible
- Code generation
  - Can we generate open api specification from spring controller?
    - Answer: yes and we probably should
  - Generate react hooks from open api specification
- We will get update what we need to have done by now
- At the end we should have automated pipeline running
- We have to write test cases
  - Backend test cases: test functionality of microservice
  - Frontend test cases: test if functionality is as intended
- Update class diagram
- Put milestones on Artemis (to keep Aniruddh in the loop)
- Authentication: User service or API gateway?
  - Answer: fine in user service (but each microservice has to call user service), @Aniruddh will check on that
- Monitoring needs to be implemented but not yet
  - Needs to be in one deployment (Kubernetes or docker compose) not necessarily both
